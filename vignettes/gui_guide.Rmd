HRaDeX is the package for the backend calculation and visualization. To make the solution more comfortable, we prepared dedicated applications. To use them, there are two function calls:

```{r eval=F}
HRaDeX::run_hradex()
HRaDeX::run_compahradex()
```

You can also use them online, here: [HRaDeX](https://hradex.mslab-ibb.pl/) and [compaHRaDeX](https://compahradex.mslab-ibb.pl/).

Should you notice any inconveniences while using them, please let us know. The best way to contact us is to use the following email: hadex@ibb.waw.pl.

# HRaDeX

HRaDeX GUI is an application for classification process for one biological state at the time. The workflow is described in the dedicated article. Here we explain the elements of GUI, with regard to every parameter.

## Settings

### Input file

The required experimental file should be the `cluster file` from DynamX 3.0 or 2.0. In the future there will be more options available, but currently only one is supported.

There is a message with the upload result. If none is provided by the user, there is loaded example file. The analysis is initiated by clicking the "Calculate things!" button. 

### Uptake calculations

#### Select state

If there is more than one state in supplied data file, there is a possibility to select one. The classification process is done on only one state at the time. When state is reselected, and the process initiated by the button, previous results are overwritten. 

#### Omit residues

The first residue is known to undergo fast back-exchange, and cannot cause the measured mass increase, as described in the literature [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438223/), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234247/). We offer a possibility to either omit the first residue (or first two) or not - depending on the user's approach to the matter.

#### Use replicate data

The data in required format - `cluster` format, contains unaggregated centroid values for each spectrum - for every charge value of peptides in every technical replicate. The `use replicate data` option allows the use of data aggregated only on replicate level, not through them. Using this option, there are as many measurement points for each time point as there are replicates. Without this option, there is only one measurement point for each time point. 

### Sequence

#### Sequence from the data

This is the sequence reconstruced only based on the experimental data.

#### Sequence from the pdb file

#### Move the start of the sequence

### Deuterium uptake controls

#### Non-deuterated control

#### Full deuterated control

#### Use as FD

#### Fractional values

### Workflow

#### Select workflow

### Class definition

#### Limits and boundaries

#### Reset the values

### Fit options

#### Number of iterations

### About

# compaHRaDeX

compaHRaDeX GUI is an application for comparison of the results of classification process (performed in HRaDeX) for two biological states at the same time.

## Settings

### Input files

Once you have processed two biological states using HRaDeX, there is a need for comparative analysis. What is necessary to perform one?

* fit_data_.csv and uc_data_.csv for the first state
* fit_data_.csv and uc_data_.csv for the second state
* PDB file structure for the protein.

fit_data_.csv is to be found in the `Fit params` tab in HRaDeX, and uc_data_.csv is in `UC Data` tab.

Of course, you can perform compartive analysis providing only some of desired files, but then not all of the fetures will be available.
