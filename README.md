# HRaDeX

HRaDeX is a part of tool family for analysing HDX-MS data, HaDeXversum. It is developed in Mass Spectrometry Lab in Institute of Biophysics and Biochemistry, Polish Acadamy of Sciences.

HRaDeX is a package for classification process of peptide-level uptake curves. While HRaDeX covers all computational processes, there are two GUIs for its functionalities.
HRaDeXGUI is an app that allows one-state classification process.
compaHRaDeX is an app for comparative analysis of classification results for two biological states, conducted separately using HRaDeXGUI. 

The applications are available for use online: [HRaDeX](https://hradex.mslab-ibb.pl/) and [compaHRaDeX](https://compahradex.mslab-ibb.pl/).

The project is currently under development.

For more information on pepitde-level analysis, see [documentation](https://hadexversum.github.io/HaDeX/) for HaDeX.
For detailed explanation of the classification workflow works see this [article](https://hadexversum.github.io/HRaDeX/articles/workflow.html).
and of visualization the results, see this [article](https://hadexversum.github.io/HRaDeX/articles/visualization.html).
